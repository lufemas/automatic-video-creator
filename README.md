# automatic-video-creator

A video creator Bot inspired by @filipedeschamps video-maker Bot.

## What it does

Making it simple:

1. This bot will ask you for content (or it will suggest you some trends from [google, imdb, (more in the future)]).
2. After, it will search on Wikipedia's API for getting information
3. After, it will search for images (with helper of IBM Watson)
4. After, it will build a video, using AfterEffects (aerender engine)
5. Finally, it will upload for youtube with title + thumbnail + tags and description.

## Technologies envolved

NodeJS - Google Trends - IMDB - Wikipedia - IBM Watson Natural Language - Google Images Search - After Effects - YouTube
